# Contract Terms

How might we wish to model contracts?

We've already modelled the rights assignment using permissions. prohibitions, and obligations. What else are we interested in?

Who is the licensor? And the licensee? Does a contract provide for affiliate rights?

We might want to know the **type** of contract: is it an exchange contract or bilateral agreement?

What is its **status**: draft, cancelled, review, approved, obsolete (same as expired?), or active?

What **licensing model** does it implement: vendor-licensed, direct-licensed, or your own paper?

We'll likely want to know the set of **documents** that make up the contract: master agreement, order form, price list, schedule, ammendment, addendum, guidance. Anything else? Do we want to capture a "replace" relationship between, say, schedules?

Are there other types of things we're interested in?

Well, a contract also gives us (and the licensor) a set of **actions** to manage the contract, like to renew it, to terminate it, to respecify the services it controls, and to reprice them. These are usually associated with a notification **obligation**.

Do we want to capture anything else?

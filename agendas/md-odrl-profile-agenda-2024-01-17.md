### Agenda

1. Key Contract Properties
It's important to tie the permissions we model back to the contracts that offer them. What do we want to say about these contracts?

Is there anything you'd like to add to this brief discussion: https://github.com/w3c/market-data-odrl-profile/blob/gh-pages/ContractTerms.md

2. Modelling Services with DCAT
Much of the licensing information we collect is of value to both permissioning systems and to catalogues. Hence, we've started using the DCAT catalogue ontology to describe services. Here's a real-world example - BFIX, Bloomberg FX Fixings: https://github.com/w3c/market-data-odrl-profile/blob/gh-pages/FixingsExample.md

What other scenarios should we test against?

3. Looping back to Content Delivery Models
This list seems to provide good coverage for exchange contracts: https://github.com/w3c/market-data-odrl-profile/blob/gh-pages/CDMs.md

But do you know of any bilateral agreements that offer new models?
